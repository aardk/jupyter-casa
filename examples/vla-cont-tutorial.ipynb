    "The maximum baseline is about 16,000 wavelengths, i.e., an angular scale of 12 arcseconds ($\\lambda/D=1/16000$). The most effective cleaning occurs with 3-5 pixels across the synthesized beam. For example, a cell size of 2.5 arcseconds will give just under 5 pixels per beam.\n",

    "The supernova remnant itself is known to have a diameter of order 9 arcminutes, corresponding to about 216 pixels for the chosen cell size. The mosaic was set up with 7 fields, 1 centered on the remnant with 6 flanking fields; the spacing of the fields was chosen based on the size of the antenna primary beam. For the choice of `ftmachine='mosaic'` (our main mosaicking algorithm), you do not have to fit the mosaic inside the inner quarter of the total image in order to prevent image artifacts arising from aliasing, we just want to have a bit of padding around the outside. Although CASA has the feature that its Fourier transform engine (FFTW) does not require a strict power of 2 for the number of linear pixels in a given image axis, it is somewhat more efficient if the number of pixels on a side is a composite number divisible by any pair of 2 and 3 and/or 5. Because `clean` internally applies a padding of 1.2 (=3x2/5) choose 480, which is 25 × 3 × 5 (so 480 × 1.2 = 576 = 26 × 32). We therefore set `imsize=[480,480]` and our mosaic fits comfortably inside the image. "
